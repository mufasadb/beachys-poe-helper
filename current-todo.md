## Development Environment Ready ðŸš€
- **Local Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/mufasadb/beachys-poe-helper
- **Docker Hub**: callmebeachy/beachys-poe-helper

## Next Steps
   - League start checklist and copy-paste templates
   - Community cheat sheets section (from Google Sheets)
   - Leveling guide with acts/zones/quests
   - Atlas progression strategies

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### AutoHotkey Scripts (ToS-Compliant Only)
- Download page with approved scripts only
- Scripts to include:
  - lutbot (approved automation)
  - Community-vetted scripts that don't violate ToS
  - Note: No flask macros (against ToS)

### Build Lists

- Filter preview functionality
- Customization instructions
- Quick download links

### Inventory Search Templates
- Copy-paste search strings for trade site
- Movement speed boots with socket colors:
  - 3 blue (3b)
  - 3 green (3g) 
  - 3 red (3r)
  - 2 blue 1 green (2b1g)
  - 2 green 1 blue (2g1b)
  - 2 red 1 green (2r1g)
  - 2 green 1 red (2g1r)
- Research existing tools to reference or copy implementation

### Vendor Recipes Page
- Complete list from community spreadsheet
- Organized by category (currency, gems, equipment)
- Easy copy-paste format

### Research Tasks (before implementation)
- **Atlas Progression**: Research existing atlas guides, decide on format (interactive tree, static guide, step-by-step)
- **Leveling Guide**: Compare existing leveling resources, determine best presentation method
- **Inventory Search Tools**: Find existing tools to reference implementation

### Community Cheat Sheets (from spreadsheet)
- Display community content from Google Sheets
- League mechanics guides:
  - Settlers mechanics
  - Sanctum strategies  
  - Expedition optimization
  - Heist cheat sheet
  - Betrayal board setup
  - Delve biome farming
  - Incursion temple priorities

### POE Dashboard
- Categorized external tool links:
  - Information: POE Wiki, poedb
  - Trading: Official trade, Awakened POE Trade
  - Crafting: Craft of Exile
  - Build Planning: Path of Building, POB.party
  - Economy: POE Ninja

## AWS Deployment Planning
- Choose between App Runner (simplest), ECS with Fargate, or EC2
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Configure environment variables and secrets

## Feature Implementation Order
1. Static content first (scripts, filters, templates)
2. POE Dashboard with external links
3. Dynamic content (lab layouts, POE Ninja builds)
4. Community features and ad integration
